## Accessibility testing tool: ACROBAT XI PRO

#### 1. Introduction

   **Adobe Acrobat** is a family of application software and Web services developed by Adobe  Inc. to view, create, manipulate, print and manage files in Portable Document Format (PDF).

  Acrobat tools make it easy to create accessible PDFs and check the accessibility of existing PDFs. You can create PDFs to meet common accessibility standards, such as Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.0 and PDF/UA (Universal Access, or ISO 14289).

- **Make PDFs accessible**: A predefined action automates many tasks, checks accessibility, and provides instructions for items that require manual fixes. Quickly find and fix problem areas.

- **Check accessibility**: The  Full Check  tool verifies whether the document conforms to accessibility standards, such as PDF/UA and WCAG 2.0.

- **Report accessibility status**: The  Accessibility Report  summarizes the findings of the accessibility check. It contains links to tools and documentation that assist in fixing problems.
