It replays realistic application usage scenarios and lets you monitor the application performance and key infrastructure metrics in real time. This lets you easily identify performance problems as they happen and determine what they are caused by

#### 2. Feature:
LoadComplete provides flexible self-service set up and execution of load test scenarios to:  


-   Replicate realistic user experiences in pre-production environment to identify performance issues before they can negatively impact visitors.

-   Improve operational quality, both inside and outside your network, by pinpointing and resolving bandwidth and configuration issues that slow pages down to a crawl.
-   Ensure that quality of service metrics are being met during scalability testing.
-   Easily monitor server performance during stress tests and load tests.
-   Test as often as you like to align load testing with your Agile sprints without having to pay extra for access to cloud resources.
-   Create multiple real-life load test scenarios to match your testing to how visitors use your Website.
